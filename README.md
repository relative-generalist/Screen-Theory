# Screen Theory

A new framework for understanding reality through bidirectional information exchange across boundaries.

## What is Screen Theory?

**Screens** are bidirectional faithful mediator interfaces that enable controlled information exchange between distinct regions or systems.

**The Wholographic Principle** asserts that boundaries between interior and exterior regions encode the mutual, causally transmissible information between them—what each can objectively know about the other through their shared interface.

**Mass as Information Generator**: In this framework, mass actively generates novel information at a rate proportional to its energy content, driving spacetime expansion and geometric structure.

**Many ramifications in multiple fields of physics, to be discussed.**
